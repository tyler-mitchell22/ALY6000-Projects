# 1. Playing in a minimum of 50% of games during the season (41 games), 
#    who were the top 5-10 players in point per game production?

# 2. Which teams had the highest sum of points among their entire roster? 
#    Which teams had the lowest sums?

# 3. Which players were the biggest detriment to their team in respect to penalty 
#    minutes taken, versus penalty minutes drawn? 
#    Which teams were also the worst in this respect?
